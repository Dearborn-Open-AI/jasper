Only the following functions may be called before the JasPer library is
initialized:

jas_get_default_conf
jas_get_image_fmttab

The JasPer library is initialized by calling exactly one of the following
functions exactly once:

jas_init
jas_init_custom

The type jas_conf_t is used to specify configuration parameters for
the library.
The library has a notion of default values for these parameters that
are established when the library is built.
These default values can be obtained via the
jas_get_default_conf function.

Initialization would typically be performed using code resembling

jas_conf_t conf;

/* Get the default configuration parameters that were selected at
when the library was built. */
jas_get_default_conf(&conf);

/*
Change any configuration parameters for which defaults are not suitable
by modifying the variable conf.
This might necessitate calling jas_get_image_fmttab if the image_fmttab
configuration parameter is being changed.
For example, the library user might choose to generate their own table
of image formats that included only a subset of the codecs included in
the library.
*/

/* Initialize the JasPer library. */
if (jas_init_custom(&conf)) {
	/* handle initialization error */
}

Some examples of using the jas_init and jas_init_custom functions can be
found in the source code for the application programs jasper, imginfo, and
imgcmp.

Cleanup of the library is performed by calling the function jas_cleanup
exactly once.

A description of the jas_conf_t type can be found in the JasPer Reference
Manual.
