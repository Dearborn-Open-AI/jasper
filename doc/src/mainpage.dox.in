@section intro Introduction

JasPer is a collection
of software (i.e., a library and application programs) for the
coding and manipulation of images.  This software can handle image
data in a variety of formats.  One such format supported by JasPer
is the JPEG-2000 format defined in ISO/IEC 15444-1.
This software was developed by
<a href="https://www.ece.uvic.ca/~mdadams">Michael Adams</a>
from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the 
University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada.

@section features Features

Some of the features of the JasPer library are as follows:

  - has multithreading support (e.g., supports per-thread contexts)
  - native support for several image codecs, including:
      - JPEG-2000 JP2 File Format Syntax (ISO/IEC 15444-1)
      - JPEG-2000 Code Stream Syntax (ISO/IEC 15444-1)
      - Portable Graymap/Pixmap (PNM)
      - Microsoft Bitmap (BMP)
      - Sun Rasterfile (RAS)
      - JPEG-2000 VM Format (PGX)
  - non-native support for following image codecs:
      - JPEG (ISO/IEC 10918-1) via IJG JPEG Library
  - can add new codecs (or disable codecs) at run time
  - can provide custom memory allocator to be used by library
  - can provide custom logging function to be used by library for
    error, warning, informational, and debugging messages
  - can place upper limit on total amount of memory used by library
  - can manage ICC profiles
  - portable code known to work on many platforms
  - can autodetect image format during decoding

Several application programs are also provided:

  - an image transcoder program for converting between image formats
  - a program for querying the properties of image, such as:
    size, number of components, and the number of bits per sample
  - a program for comparing two images using various distance metrics,
    such as PAE, MAE, and PSNR
  - an image viewer

@section news News

In release 3 of JasPer, the following notable changes were made to the API
and/or behavior of the library relative to earlier releases:

  - the jas_init function no longer registers jas_cleanup as an atexit
    handler;
    so, the library user is now responsible for invoking jas_cleanup at
    an appropriate time;
    this change was needed in order to better support the use of the library
    on some platforms
